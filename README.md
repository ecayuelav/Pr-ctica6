# Introduction

I am writing this README months after completing this code. This project marked my final endeavor before diving into the world of object-oriented programming, as it was the last project in university where I didn't utilize objects. It significantly enhanced my programming logic skills.

## Learning Experience

Reflecting on this project, I can see how much it contributed to my growth as a programmer. It served as a stepping stone towards embracing object-oriented principles. Additionally, parts of this code were reused in the creation of the Number-Match-Game (available publicly on my profile), further demonstrating its significance.

## Personal Growth

Reviewing this code now, I recognize the substantial progress I've made in programming. I can identify errors that I now rarely make, highlighting the evolution of my skills over time.

**Conclusion**

This project stands as a testament to my journey in programming, showcasing the advancements I've made and the valuable lessons learned along the way.
